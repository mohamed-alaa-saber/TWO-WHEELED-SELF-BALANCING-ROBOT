# TWO-WHEELED-SELF-BALANCING-ROBOT
 Design and control of a two-wheel self-balancing robot
 In this project is to design and implementation of PID based two wheeled self-balancing robot to solve the inclination angle problem to balance the movement of robot and to implement in real time. We are designing the code and implement an efficient selfbalancing PID algorithm using the embedded controller and to implement in real time. Accelerometer is fitted on the robot to measure the angle of tilt during load imbalance. It gives a summary of the work done in the fields of mechanical design, electronics, software design, system characterization and control theory. This wide array of fields necessary for the realization of the project holds the project up as a leading example in the field of 
mechatronics. Here special focus will be on the modelling of the robotic system and the simulation results of various control methods required for the stabilization of the system.
